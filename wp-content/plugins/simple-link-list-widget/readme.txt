You can style your list by adding the following code to the style.css file in your chosen theme:

    /* Styles for Simple Link List Widget */
    .widget_link_list ul {} /* Style for unordered list */
    .widget_link_list ol {} /* Style for ordered list */
    .widget_link_list ul li {} /* Style for unordered list item */
    .widget_link_list ol li {}  /* Style for ordered list item */
